1. Pointer variable with example explain
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used for various purposes in C, such as dynamic memory allocation, arrays, and functions.

Here is an example of how to declare and use a pointer variable in C:

int main(){
    int a = 100;
    int *ptr;
    ptr = &a;
    
    printf("%d",a);
     printf("%d",*ptr);
      printf("%u",&a);
       printf("%u",ptr);
}
